Some of the technologies user were ```Ruby on Rails``` backend as well as a ```Postgresql``` database and for the frontend ```React/Redux``` was used. These technologies were very elegant yet powerful languages to use. 

The first and most significant feature was the Authentication feature which allows a user to create an account or login to an existing account. This feature involved both the backend authentication as well as the frontend authentication. So there most definitely a lot of moving pieces in this feature and therefore making the most challenging but rewarding aspect of building this website, this was involved very specific validations, and the difficult aspect was to keep the user logged in even after refreshing. However the solution was the bootstrap the user to the window. The second feature was the events page, the events are displayed not only on the homepage under widgets but they also have their own show page. Which presents more details of the actual event. This was rather challenging as the home page included tabs for the different categories, the solution to this involved a good amount of research on having the tabs updating when clicked on.
